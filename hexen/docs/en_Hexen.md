# Hexen

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page](../player-options) contains the options needed to configure your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Weapons, artifacts, hub access, and cross-level effects (puzzle switches, etc.) have been randomized. Monsters and pickups can also be randomized. Typically, you will end up playing different levels out of order to find your keys, puzzle artifacts, and hub unlocks and eventually complete your game.

This randomizer treats hubs as individal "levels", which can be selected on a level select screen. You can exit a hub at any time by visiting the hub station at the beginning of each hub (and a couple of additional locations which would otherwise have no exit).

## What is the goal?

The goal is to complete every hub you have chosen to play.

## What is a "check" in Hexen?

Weapons, keys, and artifacts have been replaced with Archipelago checks. Most switches and triggers that affect other levels are also Archipelago checks; the exit of a hub is also considered a check, although the exit check will always mark the hub as complete. 

## What "items" can you unlock in Hexen?

Hub unlocks, weapons keys, puzzle artifacts, and cross-level effects are your main progression items. Artifacts, ammo, and armor are filler items.
