# Hexen Randomizer Setup

## Required Software

- [Hexen (e.g. Steam version)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2360/Hexen_Beyond_Heretic/)
- Archipelago Crispy Hexen (release TBD)

## Optional Software

- [ArchipelagoTextClient](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

## Installing APHexen
1. Download APHEXEN.zip and extract it.
2. Copy HEXEN.WAD from your steam install into the extracted folder.
   You can find the folder in steam by finding the game in your library,
   right clicking it and choosing *Manageâ†’Browse Local Files*. The WAD file is in the `/base/` folder.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Launch apdoom-launcher.exe
2. Choose Hexen in the dropdown
3. Enter the Archipelago server address, slot name, and password (if you have one)
4. Press "Launch Game"
5. Enjoy!

To continue a game, follow the same connection steps.
Connecting with a different seed won't erase your progress in other seeds.

## Archipelago Text Client

We recommend having Archipelago's Text Client open on the side to keep track of what items you receive and send.
APHexen has in-game messages,
but they disappear quickly and there's no reasonable way to check your message history in-game.

### Hinting

To hint from in-game, use the chat (Default key: 'T') and type !hint followed by the name of the item and then ENTER. For example: 
```
!hint Emerald Key
```
Be warned that cross-level effects have longer names and can contain special characters, e.g.:
```
!hint Seven Portals - Seven Portals - West Access (1/3)

```
## Auto-Tracking

APHexen has some tracking integrated into the level select screen.
It tells you which hubs you have unlocked and completed completed,
and how many of the checks you have completed in each hubs.
